- Hi, I’m Raymond Holsapple... a math professor at West Liberty University in West Liberty, WV.
- I’m interested in all things related to applied mathematics and how we use math to understand the world we live in though science. More specifically... I'm interested in algorithm development, bioinformatics, modeling global climate change, control theory, and machine learning.
- Right now, I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the areas of bioinformatics or climate change, especially projects that invlove both in some fashion.
- Contact Info: raymond.holsapple@gmail.com or raymond.holsapple@westliberty.edu or stop by my office in Main Hall (basement), room B46, on the main campus of West Liberty University.
